        <h2>Freaky A$$ Tech Giants</h2>
        <p>Big Tech companies have too much power. It's heartbreaking, really, how much we trust tech giants like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, or Jeff Bezos with our lives. These online platforms were supposed to innocently connect us — provide a safe haven to explore, express, and collaborate worldwide. Instead, they’ve turned every action into something that can be exploited. Every like, every post, every DM we send is tracked, documented, and used against us. The people behind these platforms don’t care about our well-being, they care about the figures in their wallets. They manipulate our emotions, amplify division, and feed us endless distractions to keep us hooked, the forbidden crack. Movements that started with good intentions, like #MeToo or Black Lives Matter, get hijacked by algorithms that thrive on outrage, turning real struggles into clickbait. It’s a sad, suffocating reality. We’ve let our unconscious habits be recorded and turned into data that fuels a cycle of addiction, anger, and loneliness. And the worst part? We don’t even realize how much we’ve lost until it’s too late. Technology was meant to bring us closer, but it’s only pulled us further apart. Our self worth is now determined through a pink-heart counter.</p><br>

        <h2>Mark Elliot Suckerberg</h2>

        <p>Mark Zuckerberg is a deeply polarizing figure whose influence over the digital world has sparked widespread controversy. He has built an empire that controls vast swathes of our online lives — yet at what cost? Zuckerberg has been accused of prioritizing profit over public good, running a platform that profits off division, misinformation, and addictive engagement tactics - he wins, while everyone else burns in putrid. Despite his meticulously crafted public persona of caring, his actions suggest a blatant disregard for privacy, democracy, and the mental well-being of users. Facebook collects huge amounts of data, spreads harmful messages, and manipulates the truth through its algorithms. This has made Zuckerberg an anomaly within the control of the future of the online world. For many, the reality behind Zuckerberg's empire is far darker than the polished facade of a tech visionary. He is the current-day Christopher Columbus; infiltrating and limiting our minds, opinions, and freedom. The concealed genocide has infected my land, 1,500 acres of land just for himself. No care for the struggling locals to live where they are rooted, no care for the dying culture that makes up the paradise, no care for anyone but himself and that top-secret compound.</p><br>

        <p><b>These are the words of the man himself... all because he got his heart broken. Innocent lives were raided; privacy was taken advantage of, consent was nowhere to be found - all because of what? Just because the man was soppy and "a little bit intoxicated." What does that tell you about his character?</b></p><br>

        <p>“Harvard Face Mash | The Process” 10.28.03 </p>

        <blockquote><b>8:13pm.</b> Erica Albright's a bitch. You think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht or do you think it's because all BU girls are bitches? Folks, for the record, she may look like a 34C but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret. She's a 34B, as in barely anything there. False advertising. I need to think of something to occupy my mind. Easy enough now I just need an idea… <br><br>

        <b>9:48pm.</b> I’m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even 10pm and it’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland facebook is open on my computer desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive. It’s not such a great idea and probably not even funny, but Billy comes up with the idea of comparing two people from the facebook, and only sometimes putting a farm animal in there. Good call Mr. Olson! I think he’s onto something.<br><br>

        <b>11:09pm.</b> Yea, it’s on. I’m not exactly sure how the farm animals are going to fit into this whole thing (you can’t really ever be sure with farm animals…), but I like the idea of comparing two people together. It gives the whole thing a very Turing feel, since people’s ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person’s hotness like they do on hotornot.com. The other thing we’re going to need is a lot of pictures. Unfortunately, Harvard doesn’t keep a public centralized facebook so I’m going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in. And that means no freshman pictures…drats. <br>

        <h2>Dangers Of Internet</h2>
        <p>The Internet is an incredible resource but also full of hidden risks that aren’t always easy to spot. The spread of misinformation is one of the biggest dangers that plague our society. With social media, false information can spread to millions of people in a matter of seconds. These platforms have the power to shape public opinion, influence elections, and even dictate trends. A manipulated image on Instagram, a conspiracy theory on X, or fake news on TikTok is quickly perceived as factual without regard to the severe consequences they have on society’s opinions. <br>

        These platforms prioritize engagement, so a sensational story or shocking headlines that get the attention of viewers can allow a creator to profit immensely, making it tempting to create false media for clicks and views. Unfortunately, most people using social media don’t take the time to fact-check what they are viewing, making the spread of fake news more dangerous than ever. This Internet dilemma has the potential to provoke division and fear just from one simple look at your social media feed, making it an emotional toll as well as an intellectual one. <br>

        Tech giants, like Mark Zuckerburg and Elon Musk, that own these platforms hold enormous power over the information that we see. The algorithms they use to decide which posts are presented on our feeds, create a curated reality of your personal life. And while there are advantages to having a personalized algorithm, the control that these individuals have to influence our thinking is too quickly overlooked. Unfortunately, these tech giants go unscathed without any responsibility for the dangers of their platforms.<br>

        With these platforms collecting so much of our personal data, cybersecurity has become a critical issue. From private messages to location data, hackers often target these platforms to access this personal information from its users. A single breach could expose millions of innocent people to fraud and identity theft.

        <h2>Pedophilia & Cat-fish</h2>
        <p> One of the most concerning dangers of social media platforms is the exploitation of predators and catfishers, particularly targeting vulnerable populations like children and teenagers. These platforms have become hunting grounds for pedophiles who exploit the anonymity that these spaces provide. They can easily create fake profiles, posing as anyone they want to be and appearing trusting to young adults. Catfishing is another increasing issue that has taken over the social media space. People can easily create fake profiles, often used for financial spamming, emotional manipulation, or grooming. While there have been efforts to minimize this dilemma from the tech giants by implementing age restrictions, these efforts are oftentimes useless and easily passed. With the large scale of social media, it would be near impossible to stop every instance of this abuse. However, it is also clear that this alarming issue is not of serious concern to these billionaires that have control over the platforms.
