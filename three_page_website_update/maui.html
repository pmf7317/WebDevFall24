      <p>For over a century, water diversion from East Maui’s streams to support commercial agriculture has deeply impacted Native Hawaiian communities and ecosystems. These streams, once sustaining the rich tradition of kalo farming and native stream life, have been siphoned away by private interests like Alexander & Baldwin (A&B). Water, which the Native Hawaiians revere as life itself — "Ola i ka wai"— was meant to be shared and preserved for all. Yet, for decades, laws have been bent to allow corporations to profit while traditional farmers and the environment suffer. This ongoing diversion threatens not only the livelihood of kalo farmers but also the delicate balance of nature and cultural heritage tied to the islands’ waters. The horror of this struggle underscores the importance of water as a communal lifeline, not a commodity for exploitation. Water access is not public in Maui. Water ownership is not public in Maui. The more they take, the less we exist.</p>

        <p>Maui's water diversion issues date back to the late 1800s, when streams were diverted for sugar plantations. Even after the plantations closed, companies like West Maui Land Company continued diverting water for residential communities and resorts. A&B/EMI/HC&S have also been extracting millions of gallons from East Maui streams using month-to-month permits without environmental assessments. Legal battles have aimed to restore water flow, and in 2022, a court reduced A&B/EMI/HC&S's diversions by a quarter. The ongoing diversions have harmed ecosystems, disrupted cultural practices, and worsened public health, especially after the 2023 wildfires in Lahaina.</p>
        <p>The diversion of water in Maui, Hawaii, has devastating impacts on local communities, particularly Native Hawaiians, leading to an increase in homelessness. Water is crucial for sustaining traditional farming practices, which many rely on for both food and income. Without access to water, crops fail, and families lose their primary means of livelihood. The loss of agricultural sustainability forces many to leave their land, pushing them into urban areas where housing is already scarce and expensive. This cycle of displacement contributes to a rising number of Hawaiian homeless, as they struggle to survive in a system that prioritizes tourism and corporate interests over indigenous rights and self-sufficiency.</p>

    <p>Following the Lahaina fire, the need for water to support rebuilding efforts has intensified Maui's long-standing water crisis, where resources are already overdrawn due to historical diversions favoring corporate agriculture and tourism. In the wake of the devastating Lahaina fire, water is urgently needed to help families and communities rebuild their lives and homes, yet this essential resource remains limited. Recovery must prioritize the people who embody Hawaiʻi’s spirit, supporting local families and preserving the Hawaiian way of life rather than allowing tourism interests to dictate water use. While rebuilding is critical, it should happen thoughtfully, respecting traditional practices and ensuring that Native Hawaiians and longtime residents have access to the resources they need to restore their livelihoods. Hawaiʻi is defined by its people and culture, and sustainable recovery means balancing immediate needs with the long-term well-being of the community.</p>
